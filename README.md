# city-traffic-lights-locator
Very simple App that allows the user to "report" the location of a traffic light in the city (or anywhere else). 
The reporter can then recommend one of the users to "confirm" the spotted traffic light. The idea is to be able to overlay this
information onto a Google Map (Places).
